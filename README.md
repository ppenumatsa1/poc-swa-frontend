## Introduction

This project is a proof of concept for a single-page web application (SWA) frontend. It demonstrates the use of modern web technologies to create a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:
```
poc-swa-frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...

```

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poc-swa-frontend.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd poc-swa-frontend
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:
